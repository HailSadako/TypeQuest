A big wet stain was on the round carpet
A blue crane is a tall wading bird
A bowl of rice is free with chicken stew
A break in the dam almost caused a flood
A brown leather bag hung from its strap
A castle built from sand fails to endure
A child's wit saved the day for us
A chink in the wall allowed a draft to blow
A clean neck means a neat collar
A cloud of dust stung his tender eyes
A cold dip restores health and zest
A cramp is no small danger on a swim
A cruise in warm waters in a sleek yacht is fun
A cup of sugar makes sweet fudge
A dash of pepper spoils beef stew
A fence cuts through the corner lot
A filing case is now hard to buy
A flat pack takes less luggage space
A force equal to that would move the earth
A fresh start will work such wonders
A fur muff is stylish once more
A gem in the rough needs work to polish
A gold ring will please most any girl
A gray mare walked before the colt
A joy to every child is the swan boat
A king ruled the state in the early days
A lame back kept his score low
A lathe cuts and trims any wood
A man in a blue sweater sat at the desk
A pencil with black lead writes best
A pink shell was found on the sandy beach
A plea for funds seems to come again
A pod is what peas always grow in
A pot of tea helps to pass the evening
A pound of sugar costs more than eggs
A quart of milk is water for the most part
A rag will soak up spilled water
A rich farm is rare in this sandy waste
A ripe plum is fit for a king's palate
A rod is used to catch pink salmon
A round hole was drilled through the thin board
A round mat will cover the dull spot
A salt pickle tastes fine with ham
A sash of gold silk will trim her dress
A saw is a tool used for making boards
A severe storm tore down the barn
A shower of dirt fell from the hot pipes
A siege will crack the strong defense
A six comes up more often than a ten
A small creek cut across the field
A smatter of French is worse than none
A speedy man can beat this track mark
A steep trail is painful for our feet
A stiff cord will do to fasten your shoe
A streak of color ran down the left edge
A strong bid may scare your partner stiff
A stuffed chair slipped from the moving van
A sullen smile gets few friends
A tame squirrel makes a nice pet
A thick coat of black paint covered all
A thin book fits in the side pocket
A thin stripe runs down the middle
A thing of small note can cause despair
A toad and a frog are hard to tell apart
A tusk is used to make costly gifts
A vent near the edge brought in fresh air
A waxed floor makes us lose balance
A whiff of it will cure the most stubborn cold
A white silk jacket goes with any shoes
A wisp of cloud hung in the blue air
A yacht slid around the point into the bay
A young child should not suffer fright
A zestful food is the hot-cross bun
Acid burns holes in wool cloth
Act on these orders with great speed
Add salt before you fry the egg
Add the column and put the sum here
Add the store's account to the last cent
Add the sum to the product of these three
Adding fast leads to wrong sums
After the dance they went straight home
All sat frozen and watched the screen
Always close the barn door tight
An abrupt start does not win the prize
At night the alarm roused him from a deep sleep
At that high level the air is pure
Bad nerves are jangled by a door slam
Bail the boat, to stop it from sinking
Bathe and relax in the cool green grass
Be sure to set the lamp firmly in the hole
Beat the dust from the rug onto the lawn
Beef is scarcer than some lamb
Better hash is made of rare beef
Birth and death mark the limits of life
Boards will warp unless kept dry
Both brothers wear the same size
Both lost their lives in the raging storm
Bottles hold four kinds of rum
Brass rings are sold by these natives
Breakfast buns are fine with a hot drink
Breathe deep and smell the piny air
Bribes fail where honest men work
Bring your best compass to the third class
Bring your problems to the wise chief
Burn peat after the logs give out
Calves thrive on tender spring grass
Canned pears lack full flavor
Cap the jar with a tight brass cover
Carry the pail to the wall and spill it there
Cars and busses stalled in snow drifts
Cats and dogs each hate the other

Choose between the high road and the low
Clams are small, round, soft, and tasty
Clothes and lodging are free to new men
Coax a young calf to drink from a bucket
Cod is the main business of the north shore
Code is used when secrets are sent
Corn cobs can be used to kindle a fire
Crack the walnut with your sharp side teeth
Crouch before you jump or miss the mark
Cut the cord that binds the box tightly
Cut the pie into large parts
Dig deep in the earth for pirate's gold
Dill pickles are sour but taste fine
Dimes showered down from all sides
Dip the pail once and let it settle
Dispense with a vest on a day like this
Do that with a wooden stick
Dots of light betrayed the black cat
Down that road is the way to the grain farmer
Draw the chart with heavy black lines
Drive the screw straight into the wood
Drop the ashes on the worn old rug
Drop the two when you add the figures
Ducks fly north but lack a compass
Dull stories make her laugh
Dunk the stale biscuits into strong drink
Each penny shone like new
Eight miles of woodland burned to waste
Either mud or dust are found at all times
Even a just cause needs power to win
Even the worst will beat his low score
Every word and phrase he speaks is true
Fairy tales should be fun to write
Fake &ones shine but cost little
Farmers came in to thresh the oat crop
Fasten two pins on each side
Feed the white mouse some flower seeds
Feel the heat of the weak dying flame
Fill the ink jar with sticky glue
Fill your pack with bright trinkets for the poor
Find the twin who stole the pearl necklace
Fine soap saves tender skin
Fish evade the net, and swim off
Five years he lived with a shaggy dog
Flax makes a fine brand of paper
Float the soap on top of the bath water
Flood the mails with requests for this book
Fly by night, and you waste little time
Footprints showed the path he took up the beach
Four hours of steady work faced us
Fruit flavors are used in fizz drinks
Get the trust fund to the bank early
Glass will clink when struck by metal
Glue the sheet to the dark blue background
Go now and come here later
Grace makes up for lack of beauty
Grape juice and water mix well
Gray paint stretched for miles around
Green ice frosted the punch bowl
Green moss grows on the northern side
Greet the new guests and leave quickly
Guess the results from the first scores
Hang tinsel from both branches
Hats are worn to tea and not to dinner
He asks no person to vouch for him
He broke a new shoelace that day
He broke his ties with groups of former friends
He carved a head from the round block of marble
He crawled with care along the ledge
He knew the skill of the great young actress
He lay prone and hardly moved a limb
He lent his coat to the tall gaunt stranger
He offered proof in the form of a lsrge chart
He ordered peach pie with ice cream
He picked up the dice for a second roll
He put his last cartridge into the gun and fired
He ran half way to the hardware store
He said the same phrase thirty times
He sent the boy on a short errand
He sent the figs, but kept the ripe cherries
He smoke a big pipe with strong contents
He takes the oath of office each March
He took the lead and kept it the whole distance
He used the lathe to make brass objects
He wheeled the bike past the winding road
He wrote down a long list of items
He wrote his last novel there at the inn
He wrote his name boldly at the top of tile sheet
Heave the line over the port side
Hedge apples may stain your hands green
Help the weak to preserve their strength
Help the woman get back to her feet
Hemp is a weed found in parts of the tropics
Her purse was full of useless trash
High seats are best for football fans
His hip struck the knee of the next player
His shirt was clean but one button was gone
His wide grin earned many friends
Hoist the load to your left shoulder
Hold the hammer near the end to drive the nail
Hop over the fence and plunge in
Hurdle the pit with the aid of a long pole
If you mumble your speech will be lost
In some forin or other we need fun
In the rear of the ground floor was a large passage
It caught its hind paw in a rusty trap
It is a band of steel three inches wide
It is hard to erase blue or red ink
It is late morning on the old wall clock
It matters not if he reads these words or those
It snowed, rained, and hailed the same morning
It takes a good trap to capture a bear
It takes a lot of help to finish these
It takes heat to bring out the odor
It was a bad error on the part of the new judge
It was done before the boy could see it
It was hidden from sight by a mass of leaves and shrubs
It's a dense crowd in two distinct ways
It's easy to tell the depth of a well
Jazz and swing fans like fast music
Jerk the cord, and out tumbles the gold
Jerk the dart from the cork target
Jerk the rope and the bell rings weakly
Jump the fence and hurry up the bank
Just hoist it up and take it away,
Keep the hatch tight and the watch constant
Kick the ball straight and follow through
Large size in stockings is hard to sell
Leave now and you will arrive on time
Leaves turn brown and yellow in the fall
Let it burn, it gives us warmth and comfort
Let's all join as we sing the last chorus
Lift the square stone over the fence
Light maple makes for a swell room
Lire wires should be kept covered
Look in the corner to find the tan shirt
Loop the braid to the left and then over
Lush fern grow on the lofty rocks
Madam, this is the best brand of corn
Many hands help get the job done
March the soldiers past the next hill
Mark the spot with a sign painted red
Men strive but seldom get rich
Men think and plan and sometimes act
Mend the coat before you go out
Mesh wire keeps chicks inside
Mince pie is a dish served to children
Most of the new is easy for us to hear
Move the vat over the hot fire
Much of the story makes good sense
Mud was spattered on the front of his white shirt
Neat plans fail without luck
Next Sunday is the twelfth of the month
Next Tuesday we must vote
Nine men were hired to dig the ruins
Nine rows of soldiers stood in line
No cement will hold hard wood
No doubt about the way the wind blows
No hardship seemed to keep him sad
North winds bring colds and fevers
Note closely the size of the gas tank
Nudge gently but wake her now
Oak is strong and also gives shade
Oats are a food eaten by horse and man
On the islands the sea breeze is soft and mild
Once we stood beside the shore
One step more and the board will collapse
Open the crate but don't break the glass
Open your book to the first page
Our plans right now are hazy
Our troops are set to strike heavy blows
Pack the kits and donâ€™t forget the salt
Pack the records in a neat thin case
Pages bound in cloth make a book
Paint the sockets in the wall dull green
Paper is scarce, so write with much care
Paper will dry out when wet
Paste can cleanse the most dirty brass
Peep under the tent and see the clowns
Pick a card and slip it under the pack
Pile the coal high in the shed corner
Pink clouds floated JTith the breeze
Pitch the straw through the door of the stable
Place a rosebush near the porch steps
Plead to the council to free the poor thief
Plead with the lawyer to drop the lost cause
Pluck the bright rose without leaves
Poached eggs and tea must suffice
Port is a strong wine with s smoky taste
Post no bills on this office wall
Pour the stew from the pot into the plate
Press the pants and sew a button on the vest
Press the pedal with your left foot
Prod the old mule with a crooked stick
Pure bred poodles have curls
Put the chart on the mantel and tack it down
Quench your thirst, then eat the crackers
Raise the sail and steer the ship northward
Rake the rubbish up and then burn it
Read just what the meter says
Read verse out loud for pleasure
Rice is often served in round bowls
Ripe pears are fit for a queen's table
Roads are paved with sticky tar
Say it slow!y but make it ring clear
Schools for ladies teach charm and grace
Screen the porch with woven straw mats
Screw the round cap on as tight as needed
See the cat glaring at the scared mouse
See the player scoot to third base
Seed is needed to plant the spring corn
Sell your gift to a buyer at a good gain
Send the stuff in a thick paper bag
Serve the hot rum to the tired heroes
Set the piece here and say nothing
Seven seals were stamped on great sheets
Sever the twine with a quick snip of the knife
Shake hands with this friendly child
Shake the dust from your shoes, stranger
Shape the clay gently into block form
She blushed when he gave her a white orchid
She called his name many times
She danced like a swan, tall and graceful
She flaps her cape as she parades the street
She has st smart way of wearing clothes
She saw a cat in the neighbor's house
She sewed the torn coat quite neatly
She was kind to sick old people
She was waiting at my front lawn
Ship maps are different from those for planes
Shut the hatch before the waves push it in
Sickness kept him home the third week
Sit on the perch and tell the others what to do
Slash the gold cloth into fine ribbons
Slidc the tray across the glass top
Slide the bill between the two leaves
Slide the box into that empty space
Slide the catch back and open the desk
Small children came to see him
Smile when you say nasty words
Smoke poured out of every crack
Smoky fires lack flame and heat
Soak the cloth and drown the sharp odor
Soap can wash most dirt away
Some ads serve to cheat buyers
Split the log with a quick, sharp blow
Steam hissed from the broken valve
Stop and stare at the hard working man
Stop whistling and watch the boys march
Sunday is the best part of the week
Sweet words work better than fierce
Tack the strip of carpet to the worn floor
Take a chance and win a china doll
Take shelter in this tent, but keep still
Take the match and strike it against your shoe
Take the winding path to reach the lake
Take two shares as a fair profit
Tea in thin china has a sweet taste
Tea served from the brown jug is tasty
Tear a thin sheet from the yellow pad
Ten pins were set in order
Tend the sheep while the dog wanders
That guy is the writer of a few banned books
That move means the game is over
The Navy attacked the big task force
The aim of the contest is to raise a great fund
The ancient coin was quite dull and worn
The baby puts his right foot in his mouth
The bank pressed for payment of the debt
The bark of the pine tree was shiny and dark
The barrel of beer was a brew of malt and hops
The beach is dry and shallow at low tide
The beam dropped down on the workmen's head
The beauty of the view stunned the young boy
The beetle droned in the hot June sun
The best method is to fix it in place with clips
The big red apple fell to the ground
The bill as paid every third week
The bills were mailed promptly on the tenth of the month
The birch canoe slid on the smooth planks
The birch looked stark white and lonesome
The black trunk fell from the landing
The blind man counted his old coins
The bloom of the rose lasts a few days
The bombs left most of the town in ruins
The boss ran the show with a watchful eye
The box is held by a bright red snapper
The box was thrown beside the parked truck
The boy owed his pal thirty cents
The boy was there when the sun rose
The brass tube circled the high wall
The bright lanterns were gay on the dark lawn
The brown house was on fire to the attic
The bunch of grapes was pressed into wine
The case was puzzling to the old and wise
The cement had dried when he moved it
The chair looked strong but had no bottom
The chap slipped into the crowd and was lost
The child almost hurt the small dog
The child crawled into the dense grass
The cigar burned a hole in the desk top
The clan gathered on each dull night
The cleat sank deeply into the soft turf
The clock struck to mark the third period
The clothes dried on a thin wooden rack
The cloud moved in a stately way and was gone
The club rented the rink for the fifth night
The coffee stand is too high for the couch
The cold drizzle will halt the bond drive
The colt reared and threw the tall rider
The cone costs five cents on Mondays
The copper bowl shone in the sun's rays
The corner store was robbed last night
The couch cover and hall drapes were blue
The crooked maze failed to fool the mouse
The crunch of feet in the snow was the only sound
The cup cracked and spilled its contents
The curtain rose and the show was on
The dark pot hung in the front closet
The desk and both chairs were painted tan
The desk was firm on the shaky floor
The dirt piles were lines along the road
The doctor cured him with these pills
The door was barred, locked, and bolted as well
The doorknob was made of bright clean brass
The drip of the rain made a pleasant sound
The dry wax protects the deep scratch
The duke left the park in a silver coach
The dune rose from the edge of the water
The dusty bench stood by the stone wall
The early phase of life moves fast
The empty flask stood on the tin tray
The facts donâ€™t always show who is right
The fan whirled its round blades softly
The farmer swapped his horse for a brown ox
The fight will end in just six minutes
The fin was sharp and cut the clear water
The first part of the plan needs changing
The first worm gets snapped early
The fish twisted and turned on the bent hook
The flint sputtered and lit a pine torch
The fly made its way along the wall
The friendly gang left the drug store
The frosty air passed through the coat
The fruit of a fig tree is apple-shaped
The fruit peel was cut in thick slices
The fur of cats goes by many names
The girl at the booth sold fifty bonds
The gloss on top made it unfit to read
The glow deepened in the eyes of the sweet girl
The gold ring fits only a pierced ear
The gold vase is both rare and costly
The good book informs of what we ought to know
The goose was brought straight from the old market
The grass and bushes were wet with dew
The grass curled around the fence post
The green light in the brown box flickered
The hail pattered on the burnt brown grass
The harder he tried the less he got done
The hat brim was wide and too droopy
The heap of fallen leaves was set on fire
The heart beat strongly and with firm strokes
The hilt of the sword was carved with fine designs
The hinge on the door creaked with old age
The hitch between the horse and cart broke
The hog crawled under the high fence
The hogs were fed chopped corn and garbage
The horn of the car woke the sleeping cop
The horse balked and threw the tall rider
The horse trotted around the field at a brisk pace
The hostess taught the new maid to serve
The houses are built of red clay bricks
The idea is to sew both edges straight
The ink stain dried on the finished page
The jacket hung on the back of the wide chair
The juice of lemons makes fine punch
The junk yard had a mouldy smell
The just claim got the right verdict
The key you designed will fit the lock
The kite dipped and swayed, but stayed aloft
The kite flew wildly in the high wind
The kitten chased the dog down the street
The knife was hung inside its bright sheath
The lake sparkled in the red hot sun
The lamp shone with a steady green flame
The large house had hot water taps
The last switch cannot be turned off
The latch on the beck gate needed a nail
The lawyer tried to lose his case
The lazy cow lay in the cool grass
The leaf drifts along with a slow spin
The lease ran out in sixteen weeks
The line where the edges join was clean
The list of names is carved around the base
The little tales they tell are false
The lobes of her ears were pierced to hold rings
The logs fell and tumbled into the clear stream
The long journey home took a year
The loss of the cruiser was a blow to the fleet
The loss of the second ship was hard to take
The lure is used to catch trout and flounder
The mail comes in three batches per day
The man went to the woods to gather sticks
The man wore a feather in his felt hat
The map had an X that meant nothing
The marsh will freeze when cold enough
The meal was cooked before the bell rang
The mule trod the treadmill day and night
The music played on while they talked
The mute muffled the high tones of the horn
The nag pulled the frail cart along
The new girl was fired today at noon
The news struck doubt into restless minds
The night shift men rate extra pay
The node on the stalk of wheat grew daily
The nozzle of the fire hose was bright brass
The odor of spring makes young hearts jump
The office paint was a dull sad tan
The old pan was covered with hard fudge
The paper box is full of thumb tacks
The peace league met to discuss their plans
The pearl was worn in a thin silver ring
The pencil was cut to be sharp at both ends
The pencils have all been used
The pennant waved when the wind blew
The petals fall with the next puff of wind
The pipe began to rust while new
The pipe ran almost the length of the ditch
The pirates seized the crew of the lost ship
The plant grew large and green in the window
The play began as soon as we sat down
The play seems dull and quite stupid
The pleasant hours fly by much too soon
The plush chair leaned against the wall
The pods of peas ferment in bare fields
The point of the steel pen was bent and twisted
The poor boy missed the boat again
The pot boiled, but the contents failed to jell
The price is fair for a good antique clock
The prince ordered his head chopped off
The pup jerked the leash as he saw a feline shape
The purple tie was ten years old
The quick fox jumped on the sleeping cat
The ram scared the school children off
The ramp led up to the wide highway
The rarest spice comes from the far East
The red paper brightened the dim stage
The red tape bound the smuggled food
The ridge on a smooth surface is a bump or flaw
The ripe taste of cheese improves with age
The rise to fame of a person takes luck
The roof should be tilted at a sharp slant
The room was crowded with a wild mob
The rope will bind the seven books at once
The rude laugh filled the empty room
The rush for funds reached its peak Tuesday
The salt breeze came across from the sea
The sand drifts over the sill of the old house
The screen before the fire kept in the sparks
The sense of smell is better than that of touch
The set of china hit, the floor with a crash
The shaky barn fell with a loud crash
The sheep were led home by a dog
The shelves were bare of both jam or crackers
The ship was torn apart on the sharp reef
The show was a flop from the very start
The sink is the thing in which we pile dishes
The sip of tea revives his tired friend
The sky in the west is tinged with orange red
The sky that morning was clear and bright blue
The slab was hewn from heavy blocks of slatâ€™e
The slang word for raw whiskey is booze
The slush lay deep along the street
The small pup gnawed a hole in the sock
The small red neon lamp went out
The smell of burned rags itches my nose
The sofa cushion is red and of light weight
The soft cushion broke the man's fall
The source of the huge river is the clear spring
The spot on the blotter was made by green ink
The square peg will settle in the round hole
The square wooden crate was packed to be shipped
The stale smell of old beer lingers
The steady drip is worse than a drenching rain
The stems of the tall glasses cracked and broke
The stitch will serve but needs to be shortened
The store walls were lined with colored frocks
The store was jammed before the sale could start
The straw nest housed five robins
The stray cat gave birth to kittens
The streets are narrow and full of sharp turns
The sun came up to light the eastern sky
The swan dive was far short of perfect
The team with the best timing looks good
The term ended in late June that year
The thaw came early and freed the stream
The theft of the pearl pin was kept secret
The third act was dull and tired the players
The three story house was built of stone
The tin box held priceless stones
The tiny girl took off her hat
The tongs lay beside the ice pail
The train brought our hero to the big town
The tree top waved in a graceful way
The tube was blown and the tire flat and useless
The two met while playing on the sand
The urge to write short stories is rare
The vamp of the shoe had a gold buckle
The vane on top of the pole revolved in the wind
The vast space stretched into the far distance
The wagon moved on well oiled wheels
The wall phone rang loud and often
The walled town was seized without a fight
The water in this well is a source of good health
The way to save money is not to spend much
The weight of the package was seen on the high scale
The wharf could be seen at the farther shore
The wide road shimmered in the hot sun
The work of the tailor is seen on each side
The wreck occurred by the bank on Main Street
The wrist was badly strained and hung limp
The young girl gave no clear response
The young kid jumped the rusty gate
The young prince became heir to the throne
The youth drove with zest, but little skill
The zones merge in the central part of town
Their eyelids droop for want of sleep
There are many ways to do these things
There are more than two factors here
There is a fine hard tang in salty air
There is a lag between thought and act
There is a strong chance it will happen once more
There the flood mark is ten inches
There was a sound of dry leaves outside
These coins will be needed to pay his debt
These days a chicken leg is a rare dish
These pills do less good than others
These thistles bend in a high wind
They are men nho walk the middle of the road
They are pushed back each time they attack
They could laugh although they were sad
They felt gay when the ship arrived in port
They floated on the raft to sun their white backs
They sang the same tunes at each party
They slice the sausage thin with a knife
They told wild tales to frighten him
They took the axe and the saw to the forest
They took their kids from the public school
Thick glasses helped him read the print
Thieves who rob friends deserve jail
This horse will nose his way to the finish
This is a grand season for hikes on the road
This plank was made for walking on
This strong arm shall shield your honor
This will lead the world to more sound and fury
Those last words were a strong statement
Those words were the cue for the actor to leave
Three for a dime, the young peddler cried
Throw out the used paper cup and plate
Tight curls get limp on rainy days
Time brings us many changes
Tin cans are absent from store shelves
To have is better than to wait and hope
To make pure ice, you freeze water
To reach the end he needs much courage
To send it now in large amounts is bad
Torn scraps littered the stone floor
Trample the spark, else the flames will spread
Try to have the court decide the case
Try to trace the fine lines of the painting
Tuck the sheet under the edge of the mat
Turn on the lantern which gives us light
Twist the valve and release hot steam
Two blue fish swam in the tank
Two plus seven is less than ten
Type out three lists of orders
Use a pencil to write the first draft
Wake and rise, and step into the green outdoors
Watch the log float in the wide river
We admire and love a good cook
We are sure that one war is enough
We don't get much money but we have fun
We don't like to admit our small faults
We dress to suit the weather of most days
We find joy in the simplest things
We frown when events take a bad turn
We like to see clear weather
We need an end of all such matter
We need grain to keep our mules healthy
We now have a new base for shipping
We talked of the slide show in the circus
We tried to replace the coin but failed
Weave the carpet on the right hand side
What joy there is in living
When the frost has come it is time for turkey
When you hear the bell, come quickly
Where were they when the noise started
Whitings are small fish caught in nets
Will you please answer that phone
Wipe the grease off his dirty face
Women form less than half of the group
Wood is best for making toys and blocks
Write a fond note to the friend you cherish
Write at once or you may forget it
Write fast, if you want to finish early
Xew pants lack cuffs and pockets
Yell and clap as the curtain slides back
You cannot brew tea in a cold pot
